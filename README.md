# Image-Caption-Generator

Image caption generation has emerged as a challenging and important area of research following advances in statistical language modeling and image recognition. The field combines state-of-the-art models of natural language processing and computer vision, the two main areas of artificial intelligence.

The Image Caption Generator project aims to develop an innovative solution that generates descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. This project combines the 
domains of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to enable a model to understand the content of an image and describe it in a human-like language such as English. 
By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract image features and Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) units to generate coherent and meaningful captions, we aim to create an advanced automatic image captioning tool.

We use the widely used and diverse Flickr8K dataset to train our image caption generator model. This dataset contains 8000 unique images, with each image accompanied by five different sentences describing its content. Utilizing this rich dataset allows us to build a model that can generate diverse and informative labels for a wide variety of images.
There are also other large datasets such as Flickr_30K and MSCOCO, but training the network can take weeks.

Throughout the project, we review existing literature and research in image captioning, computer vision, and NLP. Using previous advances and knowledge, we aim to develop an efficient and accurate video caption generator that pushes the boundaries of automatic captioning technology.
